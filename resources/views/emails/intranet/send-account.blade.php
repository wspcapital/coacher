Dear {{$user->full_name}},<br><br>
Thank you for your participation in a Pinnacle Performance Company workshop. In order to further support the retention of the skills you worked so hard on, your company has also given you access to the Pinnacle Learning Portal. <br>

The Portal contains many tools, tips, and references you can use, print, and take along with you, as well as video tips from our master trainers and video examples from some of the great speakers of the past and present. <br>

You can access these tools immediately with the credentials provided below. In the meantime, we are editing and compiling all of the great video work everyone did and will be loading that to the Portal as well. <br>

As soon as we have that loaded, you will be receiving a second email notification that your videos are available.<br><br>

<br>Login: {{$user->email}}<br>
Password: {{$password}}<br>

Your login credentials are case sensitive. We recommend that you copy and paste them into the login page to ensure you have no troubles logging in. <br><br>

You will have access to the Portal and the general retention material for one (1) year from today. Your videos will be available for 30 days from the date we post them and send you notice. <br><br>

Please take advantage of these tools and continue to practice what you have learned! <br><br>
