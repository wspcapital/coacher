Determined to not let PTSD take over his life, Host posits, &ldquo;Who you are now, is now who you used to be. You have an opportunity to grow into who you&rsquo;re going to become.&rdquo;&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Living that mantra, Host says he turned his limp into a strut and is determined to help other returning soldiers. By sharing his experiences with wider audiences, he intends for other soldiers to learn they&rsquo;re not alone and to advance ways to help soldiers adjust to a different life.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>On September 13 of last year, Host spoke on a panel entitled "Transitions &amp; New Beginnings - Linking Alliances to Evolving Needs" at the 2012 Warrior-Family Symposium, cosponsored by Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) and the National Defense Industrial Association, in Washington, D.C. His and another soldier&rsquo;s testimony were given to address the &ldquo;growing and changing needs of the wounded warrior population, and provided helpful feedback to the organizations and government programs that assist them.&rdquo;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>He also recently shared his experience with Pepperdine&rsquo;s choir students, San Diego State University&rsquo;s Chamber Singers, and the Malibu High School&rsquo;s Chamber Choir to help inspire their upcoming tribute and benefit concert on April 13th.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>To prepare for the Pepperdine speech, Host worked with G. Riley Mills, Pinnacle Performance Company&rsquo;s co-founder and chief operating officer, to develop the core theme and supporting messages as well as the presentation&rsquo;s structure, build, and flow to effectively keep the audience engaged. Mills also coached Host on how to anticipate and properly prepare for difficult questions during the Q&amp;A session at the end. Before the Pepperdine speech, Host attended a two-day Pinnacle Performance Company communication and presentation skills workshop organized by his employer that focused on how he delivered his messages.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&ldquo;Ben is a good kid with an amazing story to tell,&rdquo; said Mills. &ldquo;He has all the content, it was just a matter of helping him shape it.&rdquo;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Host said, &ldquo;My heart&rsquo;s desire is to be a light for all groups affected by the struggles many face in the transitioning from war time experiences.

It can difficult to describe on its own, but when encountering those that possess it, it is undeniable. They are the people that light up rooms, sway voters, or become figureheads. What makes certain people more influential and successful than others? Is charisma actually a skill that can be learned?</p>\r\n<p>Pinnacle certainly believes so, and so do John Neffinger and Matthew Kohut, authors of <em>Compelling People: The Hidden Qualities That Make Us influential.</em> Unsurprisingly, Neffinger and Kohut make the case that others&rsquo; perceptions of you and your decisions are the most important factors in determining how successful and influential you are, oftentimes more important than the results of your actions. They make a strong argument for the power of confident, assertive body language and a level of self-awareness that aligns with the opinions of those around you. None of this should come as a shock to anyone that&rsquo;s participated in a Pinnacle workshop.</p>\r\n<p>What <em>is </em>fascinating about <em>Compelling People</em> is the authors distill &ldquo;influence&rdquo; down to two main qualities: <strong>strength </strong>and <strong>warmth</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Strength, as defined in the book, is &ldquo;a person&rsquo;s capacity to make things happen with abilities and force of will.&rdquo; Productivity and accomplishment are powerful motivators, and strength demonstrates the capability to get results.</p>\r\n<p>Warmth is defined as &ldquo;the sense a person shares our feelings, interests, and view of the world.&rdquo; Essentially, we like people who are like us.</p>\r\n<p>Strength garners respect, warmth reaps support. When someone simultaneously projects both qualities, we look to them for leadership while investing our trust they have our best interests at heart.</p>\r\n<p>While examining many of the world&rsquo;s most influential people, it may be hard to describe these qualities in such concrete terms (like trying to describe a color); but that doesn&rsquo;t mean the effects are a complete mystery. Why then, when there are so many examples of influential people, is the combination of these two qualities so rare? The authors argue it is for two reasons:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Our self-perceptions don&rsquo;t match how others view us.</strong> Accurate self-awareness is a difficult boon to acquire. It requires much self-reflection, open-mindedness and objective critique. Many people already feel they possess the necessary qualities to be great leaders, but may, in the view of colleagues or friends, lack one or both of the above qualities.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Influence requires walking a fine line.</strong> Finding the sweet spot on the strength/warmth tightrope is difficult. Too strong and you&rsquo;re overbearing. Not strong enough and you&rsquo;re a pushover. Too warm and you seem too eager-to-please. Not warm enough and people think you&rsquo;re cold. Inhabiting the &ldquo;Goldilocks zone&rdquo; in the middle of both is a delicate balance.</p>\r\n<p>We know the Pinnacle Method works. It&rsquo;s been used, consciously and unconsciously, by influential people for millennia. <em>Compelling People</em> helps to further codify the cause and effect with observational science. Red Carpet recommends the book to anyone looking to gain more insight into being a better leader (after you read <em>The Pin Drop Principle</em>, of course).</p>', '1', 'en'),

Aside from the obvious, what\'s your biggest challenge when doing these races? &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>IA:&nbsp;</strong>Swimming. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC:&nbsp;</strong>Really? &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>IA:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, I\'ve never learned to swim freestyle. I\'ve worked with several different instructors who insist I can swim, but I\'ve never felt comfortable or confident in the water. Prior to a race, sometimes I start having anxiety attacks.</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC:&nbsp;</strong>What do you do?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>IA:&nbsp;</strong>I take a few deep breaths before starting. I also had never learned to properly train until I reached out to Jenna Parker (<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001rnlSnPlM_qzbt79JwtGQk1m_qSSL7i3XyfFCUfn1VtdubQd4n-dG--PLO94WBSRVCY3PE4nQFwRjQI_GCT6FLTTrrBptUf1BIUkvbkwyw-o72K-f8GsrP97gR2j7ZUx3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.thejennaparker.com</a>).

Someone to be my eyes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC:&nbsp;</strong>Before the Chicago triathlon (August 23rd) your guide went down with an injury before the race. What went through your mind when you found out?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>IA:&nbsp;</strong>My heart sank. Trust is the biggest aspect of the relationship with my guide. I feel they need to know what I do best and my shortcomings. I need to trust they will help me, especially through my anxiety in the swim. I had never raced with Dan (Daniel Tun, the injured guide), so the Chicago triathlon was an opportunity to learn about each other under race conditions. Since he was going to be my race guide for the World Championship in London, we needed Chicago to build that trust.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC:&nbsp;</strong>Do you have a guide for London?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>IA:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, Justin Sternberg. He helped me qualify for the 2013 Paratriathlon US Nationals. I am beyond excited that we\'re teaming up again.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC:&nbsp;</strong>World Championship in London. This is the big time! What level of competition are you expecting?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>IA:&nbsp;</strong>In my category, thirteen of the fastest totally blind males will race. I\'m hoping to stay close in the swim, then hammer hard on the bike and run. Knowing my swim is not good, I\'ve worked extremely hard to make my bike and run even stronger in case I need to chase down the others.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC:&nbsp;</strong>Sounds like you know your game pretty well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>IA:&nbsp;</strong>Absolutely. You have to. Above all, I just want to represent the United States to the best of my ability.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC:&nbsp;</strong>What got you interested in triathlons in the first place?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>IA:&nbsp;</strong>Remember ABC\'s Wide World of Sports?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC:&nbsp;</strong>With the Agony of Defeat skier?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>IA:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah. Well, there was an image of Julie Moss, crawling to the finish line of the 1982 Ironman Triathlon in Kona, Hawaii. At the time I didn\'t know what the Ironman was or why she was crawling, but the image stayed with me. When I got older I used to watch Fit Nation. I kept catching the same episode of Insider Training which featured Lokelani McMichael (the youngest person to complete the Ironman Triathlon.)&nbsp; Each time I\'d see the episode I\'d get more inspired, until I finally decided to see if a blind person could compete in triathlons.&nbsp; I discovered many had, so I decided to join their ranks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC:&nbsp;</strong>And here you are, competing for the world championship.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>IA:&nbsp;</strong>It\'s been a wild ride and a long road.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC:&nbsp;</strong>A marathon, not a sprint, right?

Science and Red Carpet have the answer.</p>\r\n<p>Brain cramps are known among scientists as &ldquo;maladaptive brain activity changes,&rdquo; and there are two instances when they are likely to occur: extremely high pressure and extremely low pressure moments. In a previous article (available in our archives) Red Carpet talked about high pressure moments, and the difficulty our brains have when intently thinking about and focusing on tasks that should be highly autonomous. Low pressure moments are equally tricky to navigate, and the last thing any presenter wants is for a low pressure to suddenly become the opposite.</p>\r\n<p>To use an automotive metaphor, maladaptive brain activity changes is a fancy way of saying your brain&rsquo;s grinding gears. It&rsquo;s trying to switch between cognitive modes, and your mental transmission is getting stuck between speeds.</p>\r\n<p>Our brains are lazy. Whenever there&rsquo;s any chance to kick off the cerebral shoes and lounge around, it takes advantage of it. This occurs when performing a rote or routine activity (such as driving home from work or getting ready for bed) or in a moment where behavior is predictable (listening to a coworker drone on during a conference call). Like something out of an old Star Trek episode, our minds transfer power to critical systems to keep the ship running efficiently. While this transfer is taking place, there&rsquo;s a gap between our conscious and subconscious mind. If the timing&rsquo;s right (or should we say wrong?) and you happen to be thinking about something right then, there&rsquo;s a chance it might get lost in the gap. Sometimes things just fall through on their own. If you&rsquo;ve ever missed a turn driving home or forgotten something because you zoned out for a second, you&rsquo;ve experienced a maladaptive brain activity change, or brain fart.</p>\r\n<p>So how do we avoid being embarrassed by our brain&rsquo;s desire for a power nap? Science&rsquo;s best suggestion is to get your mind to ride the sweet spot between low and high stakes. Not so low that your brain goes on autopilot, but not so high that you obsess over every word you say. Pinnacle&rsquo;s concept of intention is actually a great solution, because it encourages you to rely on the reflexive preparation you&rsquo;ve done but also actively engage your audience so you never go passive. If there&rsquo;s one silver lining, it&rsquo;s that low stakes brain freezes are always isolated incidents. Once your mind realizes your mistake, it triggers an emergency startup sequence and goes on high alert.</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, brain cramps are a great warning system. They let you know if you&rsquo;re taking something too seriously or not seriously enough without too much damage done. With good preparation and a relaxed approach, you&rsquo;re bound to keep your brain&rsquo;s temperature above freezing.</p>', '1', 'en'),

A racing heart. Your mind goes blank.</p>\r\n<p>Just a few of the common symptoms that trouble us whenever we step in front of an audience. The Fight or Flight response has a way of triggering at the worst possible time. What helped keep us alive millennia ago doesn&rsquo;t do much for us when we&rsquo;re standing in the board room. &ldquo;Flight&rdquo; is rarely an option is the professional world; and &ldquo;fight&rdquo; certainly won&rsquo;t get you that promotion you&rsquo;ve been after.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Red Carpet has some bad news for you. Those sweaty palms aren&rsquo;t going anywhere. Your body has a vested interest in keeping you alive, so unless you can consciously control your nervous system you&rsquo;re in the same boat as 7 billion other people.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Red Carpet also has some good news. While you can&rsquo;t directly change your body&rsquo;s reaction to perceived threats, you <em>can</em> change what your body <em>perceives to be a threat</em>.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The conversion of <em>distress </em>(bad stress) to <em>eustress </em>(good stress) really comes down to two things: preparation and perception. In Pinnacle workshops and elsewhere on this site we make a big deal about preparing properly. There are no magic words or secret techniques. Putting in the time practicing is one of the few surefire ways to increase your confidence.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Altering perceptions of a situation may be more difficult, but it can pay substantial dividends. In a recent study published in <em>Clinical Psychological Science</em>, subjects were asked to deliver a short talk detailing their strengths and weaknesses. Prior to the talk, half of the participants were encouraged to reinterpret their bodies&rsquo; threat responses as positive. Through verbal encouragement and the presentation of scientific studies on the benefits of stress, researchers did their best to reframe the participants&rsquo; perception of the event.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Those that received prior coaching demonstrated less of a threat response and also felt more comfortable with the symptoms they were experiencing. By simply changing how the speakers viewed their stress, it enhanced their confidence and helped them perform better.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder, but apparently so is our stress response. Our sympathetic nervous system has no reason to trigger if it doesn&rsquo;t perceive a threat. Combine preparation with an active attempt to embrace your distress as eustress, and your confidence and performance levels should both rise.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Red Carpet encourages you to remember that the next time you&rsquo;re about to go caveman in front of the Board.</p>', '1', 'en'),

A Stanford University study revealed that, of all the motions a poker player made, the way his arms pushed chips into the pot was the most predictive of the quality of his hand. Researchers at Princeton University found that, when shown pictures of a victorious athlete&rsquo;s face or body, subjects more accurately described the emotional context when viewing the body alone. What do these three instances tell us?<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The face is not the first thing to observe when determining someone&rsquo;s true feelings.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you think this sounds counterintuitive (Red Carpet agrees), you&rsquo;re not alone. In fact, when asked, most respondents <em>believe</em> they process another&rsquo;s feelings because of facial expressions, even if what&rsquo;s happening from the neck down has much more impact.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that facial expressions don&rsquo;t matter (they do!); it&rsquo;s that most adults have very good poker faces. One of the most important social skills we all possess is the ability to mask our feelings when we need/want to. If our faces betrayed our true feelings in every situation, imagine the awkward situations that would arise. Poker faces are a learned behavior that helps us survive in polite society.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So how we do we learn to decipher the poker face so we can all move to Vegas and make millions?

A handshake. A thumbs-up. A certain gesture made when someone cuts you off in traffic. Those all carry definitive, pre-defined meaning, but most gestures do not. Instead of thinking, &ldquo;He crossed his arms, so he must be defensive,&rdquo; more accuracy is found in the overall impression created by gestures and other physical cues.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>You&rsquo;re Already an Expert. </strong>You&rsquo;ve been reading body language your entire life and are a pro at reacting to it. Most of your decoding happens unconsciously, however, so it can be difficult to transfer those observations to the conscious mind. Listen to your gut. Ask it questions. With practice, you&rsquo;ll start to see and understand the intention cues that are affecting you.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Red Carpet wishes you luck and hopes to see you on the next World Series of Poker.

Pinnacle diagnoses them as verbal viruses. Linguistic pathologists know them as <em>speech disfluencies</em>. No matter what you call them they are infectious and they are everywhere.</p>\r\n<p><br /> In the United States the common offenders are &ldquo;um&rdquo; and &ldquo;uh&rdquo; and, among youth, &ldquo;like.&rdquo; &nbsp;Russians call them &ldquo;vermin words&rdquo; and use the English equivalents of &ldquo;this&rdquo; and &ldquo;that.&rdquo; French speakers might use &ldquo;<em>quoi</em>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>bah</em>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>ben</em>.&rdquo;American Sign Language even has a way to sign &ldquo;um.&rdquo;<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Why do we commit these sins of syntax? With their use being so widespread, is it possible they serve a productive purpose within our speech?<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Researchers have multiple theories to explain why we insert these non-words into our everyday speech. The most obvious is that they are stalling mechanisms. When we are put in situations that call for impromptu speaking, we buy ourselves time to think and plot our semantic course by peppering our sentences with fillers.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Another explanation for speech disfluencies is that they are a verbal expression of nervous energy. We all give off body language cues (called <em>pacifiers</em>) indicating when we are uncomfortable. Fillers are an extension of that concept, only expressed through language.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps most interesting is the third theory, which paints verbal fillers as something that actually <em>benefits</em> the audience. Listeners need time to process incoming words and ideas. Verbal viruses allow for that occur while indicating the speaker has not completely finished. Fillers are nonverbal ellipses, while pauses are definitive periods, and some theorize that each has its own use.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Red Carpet can hear you now. &ldquo;Uh, sounds like verbal fillers are a <em>good</em> thing. So, uh, why should I, like, get rid of them?&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s why.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While it may be true that our brain&rsquo;s listening center does an excellent job of filtering out many fillers (listeners frequently report hearing only a fraction of a speaker&rsquo;s disfluencies), the efficacy decreases as the importance of the message increases. In other words, we listen more intently when we really care about what&rsquo;s being said. Generally speaking, audiences report verbal fillers as indicators of lack of confidence and preparation. In addition, any audience benefits to be gained from using them are only applicable in conversational situations, which most presentations are not.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All is not lost. There are ways to eliminate and reduce the amount of interjectory sounds you&rsquo;re involuntarily producing. This month&rsquo;s Pinnacle Refresher will detail methods to cure the verbal virus contagion.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Until then, Red Carpet encourages you to&hellip;<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&hellip;pause.</p>', '1', 'en'),

In the last 15 minutes? How may emails have you sent? Texts? You don&rsquo;t have to be a rocket scientist to notice that frequent face-to-face (and even ear-to-ear) communication is quickly becoming a thing of the past. Whether because of time pressure, distance or just plain convenience, instant, digital communication becomes more and more pervasive every year. What does that mean for our future as communicators, especially in the professional world?<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>According to a 2011 University of Cambridge study, only half the respondents preferred face-to-face interactions to all other types, a significant decline from previous years. What&rsquo;s more, one third of those surveyed confessed to occasionally feeling overwhelmed and desiring escape from the pressures of technological communication. Professional environments exacerbate both numbers. Across the world, workers would rather email or SMS, but sometimes at the cost of their sanity.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We love digital communication for obvious reasons: the speed and efficiency can&rsquo;t be beat; but the characteristics that make it appealing are also its biggest drawbacks. Sometimes speed and efficiency don&rsquo;t enhance communication&mdash;they worsen it.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Susan Tardanico, a communications coach and longtime executive consultant, believes we have &ldquo;exchanged quality for quantity&rdquo; when it comes to business communication. Essentially, the siren&rsquo;s call of saying more to more clients/coworkers is too much for people to resist, and people rarely stop to consider if it&rsquo;s the best way to get their message across (think about this the next time you&rsquo;re about to hit &ldquo;reply all&rdquo; on an email).</p>\r\n<p><br /> So how can we take advantage of all the benefits technology offers us without making others part of the 33% that feel overwhelmed? Here are some recommendations assembled from media and communications experts:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Think before pressing &ldquo;Send.&rdquo;</strong> If the email or text is a simple request/question/answer, then electronic communication is the way to go. If you think your email will lead to a lengthy chain, or if typing your message would take longer than an actual conversation, it might be time to call/talk to your recipient.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Connection is not conversation. </strong>Because of the ease of electronic communication it is also the most meaningless. For important messages or recipients, a conversation is almost always the right choice.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>When it doubt, talk it out.</strong> If you think there is any chance something you type could be misconstrued, talk instead. It&rsquo;s seemingly easier to electronically communicate about emotionally charged subjects, but it also heightens aggressive reactions. Proximity to people encourages level-headedness.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>No-tech times. </strong>Establish periods (even if they&rsquo;re brief), during meetings or communal lunches, when digital devices are switched off, no exceptions. Actively encourage others to contact you by means other than email and SMS. Experiment with increasing the amount of non-electronic communication you participate in and note how (if) it affects your productivity.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>By being more conscious about how we use technology, we can ensure digital devices enhance our communication, not substitute for it.</p>', '1', 'en'),

What follows is an excerpt&mdash;the entire interview is available in the Red Carpet archives.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Red Carpet: </strong>All right, Karen, here&rsquo;s your warm-up question. How do you define &ldquo;good communication skills&rdquo;?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Karen Jaw-Madson</strong>: Good communication skills require two things: effective preparation and intended outcome.&nbsp; Many people tend to focus on just the outcome of good communication, but I would argue that the preparation for the communication is even more important. That&rsquo;s where the real work happens.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC</strong>: I know a lot of people who&rsquo;d say you just used a dirty word: preparation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>KJM</strong>: (<em>laughs</em>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC</strong>: What gives with that?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>KJM</strong>: Most of us need some form of preparation, whether we like it or not. Even if it&rsquo;s just thinking and reflecting. Some are more dedicated than others, and the outcomes bear that out. Thoughtfulness and empathy are required to understand the audience and their needs, to select the appropriate tone, to organize the information properly, to choose the right words in the right amount of time, et cetera. All for a desired effect.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC</strong>: I love hearing words like &ldquo;thoughtfulness&rdquo; and &ldquo;empathy.&rdquo; Our concept of intention is all about the &ldquo;how&rdquo; a message is delivered. It&rsquo;s all about the audience. Doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s easy, though.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>KJM</strong>: (<em>smiles</em>)No way. We wouldn&rsquo;t have our jobs if it was.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC</strong>: (<em>laughs</em>) <em>You</em> would. I&rsquo;d be blogging.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>KJM</strong>: I blog too!&nbsp; Good news is that it gets easier over time, and that being a good communicator pays off many times over.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC</strong>: Workplaces and HR are filled with jargon and buzz-phrases. &ldquo;Understanding your audience&rdquo; is one that gets tossed around a lot. What&rsquo;s your take?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>KJM</strong>: It&rsquo;s almost impossible to overestimate an audience&rsquo;s impact on your communication. Knowing their context should influence everything you do. Ignoring it can result in disaster. Are you familiar with design thinking?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC</strong>: Wait, who&rsquo;s asking the questions here?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>KJM</strong>: (<em>laughs</em>) It&rsquo;s relevant, I promise.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC</strong>: Hit me.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>KJM</strong>: Design thinking grew from designers taking a human-centered approach to developing desirable products and applying it more broadly to experiences in other contexts. For communication, this means putting the unmet needs of the audience above all else. Focusing on your audience&rsquo;s needs ensures the <em>design</em> of your communication will be relevant and impactful.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s lots of different ways of doing this, but keep in mind that:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>It&rsquo;s not about what you think, it&rsquo;s about what they think</li>\r\n<li>You should actually engage them</li>\r\n<li>It&rsquo;s not always what they tell you, but it&rsquo;s how they behave and why.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>RC</strong>: Sounds fascinating. I&rsquo;m going to Wikipedia that. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking</a>)</p>\r\n<p>You were an HR executive for a long time. What&rsquo;s a critical communication trait workplaces should be looking for when hiring?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>KJM</strong>: In all the hiring I&rsquo;ve done, regardless of the job level, I looked for whether the candidate could <em>discern </em>and<em>organize</em> what to say and how to say it as intended.&nbsp; No matter their job title, they would be representing a function, perspective, the organization, their employees, their co-workers, etc., and they would have to do it well.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC</strong>: Has anything changed now that you&rsquo;re an independent consultant?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>KJM</strong>: I look at the same criteria when choosing partners on a client&rsquo;s project.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the same rationale&mdash;I have to be comfortable with a partner representing me.&nbsp; Evaluating communication style and skill in this different context is both affirming and interesting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC</strong>: When you have multiple candidates that possess good communication skills, how do you differentiate?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>KJM</strong>: Differentiation happens when the skills are paired with authenticity.&nbsp; Communicating in a manner that aligns with your core values and your personal style builds credibility. The converse is also true&mdash;you risk losing credibility if you communicate in a way that isn&rsquo;t true to who you are.&nbsp; Audiences are very perceptive.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC</strong>: Any recommendation for someone seeking to boost their communication skill level?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>KJM</strong>:A strong communicator should have a healthy dose of self-awareness so they not only understand themselves, but also how others might perceive them. If you&rsquo;re not sure how to go about doing this, get a communications coach or someone knowledgeable that will provide honest feedback.&nbsp; They can also prove to be invaluable in practicing your communication skills so you aren&rsquo;t going it alone.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC</strong>: All right, last question, Karen. Pinnacle loves to use thought-provoking quotes in our materials. Do you have a favorite?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>KJM</strong>: &ldquo;Our worlds are formed by the questions we ask.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC</strong>: Good one.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>KJM</strong>: There are different versions of this idea out there, but I attribute this quote to David Cooperrider. He introduced the concept of appreciative inquiry.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC</strong>: Something else to Wikipedia! (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appreciative_inquiry">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appreciative_inquiry</a>)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>KJM</strong>: (<em>laughs</em>) It&rsquo;s an opportunities-based perspective and methodology for leveraging strengths for a better world. I love this quote because it&rsquo;s a reminder to be thoughtful about how we frame our questions, which in turn communicates our perspective and therefore creates our realities. That&rsquo;s powerful stuff if you ask me.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC</strong>: Indeed. Wow, Karen, I&rsquo;m leaving here excited and inspired to learn more about different ways of looking at communication.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>KJM</strong>: I&rsquo;m glad.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my &ldquo;intention&rdquo; in the work that I do, to provoke new ways of looking at challenges and create opportunities that didn&rsquo;t exist before.&nbsp; In this way, I hope to make a positive difference in people&rsquo;s lives.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC</strong>: You&rsquo;re very good at it.

Or have you withheld your own views out of fear of being seen as unsupportive? If so, you have most likely encountered the negative repercussions of <em>groupthink</em>.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Groupthink occurs when individuals sacrifice their opinions and unique perspectives for the sake of consensus and self-preservation. In the business world, it is one of the largest barriers to open and effective communication.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While much has been written about groupthink in the preceding decades, the foundational work began with Dr. Irving Janis&rsquo;s 1972 book, <em>Victims of Groupthink</em>.&nbsp; In it, Janis argues that many of history&rsquo;s notable disasters, from the atrocities of World War II to the Watergate scandal and beyond, could be attributed to groupthink. Specific motivators and circumstances become large inhibitors to communication, and it can be just as destructive on a personal level.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How can we recognize groupthink when it&rsquo;s happening? How can we anticipate its occurrence? According to Janis and other psychologists, there are distinct characteristics/causes of a groupthink environment:<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>High Level of Cohesion.</strong> When a group is tightly knit and insulated from outside input, individuation is often at risk.&nbsp; The more homogenous a group is, the more likely it is for groupthink to take hold.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Strong, Partial Leadership.</strong> A leader&rsquo;s aggressive communication style combined with a strong bias will oftentimes do more than discourage group members from speaking out. Others may subconsciously realign their opinions to match that of the leader&rsquo;s.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>High Stress.</strong> The more threatened a group feels, by deadlines, failure or past experiences, the more likely it is to engage in groupthink. There is safety to be found in unanimity.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Once groupthink has taken root it can be difficult to dislodge. Changing group personnel and encouraging open feedback (even if it&rsquo;s anonymous) will sometimes work, as will just making the group aware of the situation.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you think your team is being impacted by groupthink, here are some additional tactics to encourage individual expression:<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Assign a Devil&rsquo;s Advocate.</strong> Choose someone from within the group to do everything they can to find holes in the group&rsquo;s plan/decision/etc. With group support for rocking the boat, the individual will feel much less threatened.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>External Feedback.</strong> To minimize the one vs. many environment that can exacerbate groupthink, each member of the team must discuss the group&rsquo;s decisions with an outside source. That source&rsquo;s reactions must be brought to the group and evaluated objectively.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Contingencies.</strong> The group must agree upon one or two viable solutions/decisions in addition to the one being made. This will necessitate a broader range of opinions and discourage single-mindedness.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The effects of groupthink are subtle but powerful. By staying vigilant and take steps to reduce its impact and frequency, we&rsquo;ll all stand to be more productive and attend fewer meetings. And Red Carpet doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s groupthink for us all to agree that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>', '1', 'en'),

Where they are focused, the duration of eye contact, the activity of muscles around them are just of few of the subtle signs that can reveal volumes about one&rsquo;s message and emotional state.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Proponents of the theory of neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) claim the eyes play a large role in revealing the innermost workings of the mind. You may have seen fictionalized examples of NLP on shows such as FOX&rsquo;s <em>Lie to Me </em>or TNT&rsquo;s <em>Leverage</em>. In short, NLP states how one moves his or her eyes when responding to a question might say a lot about the veracity of the reply.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So Red Carpet is here to make you a better liar (possibly&hellip;nothing is 100% predictive, after all).

Red Carpet does not mean to present these theories as fact, but merely to show that fascinating research and ideas are continually being explored to unravel the mysteries of communication.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What we can all agree on is that our eyes, oftentimes, say more than our mouths ever can.

It would be a rare find to locate someone who had not been categorized by a Myers-Briggs behavioral test or similar tool.

Red Carpet had the great fortune to sit down with her and get her unique perspective on communication and its impact within the field of Human Resources.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Red Carpet:</strong> As a coordinator of HR professionals, what defines &ldquo;good communication skills&rdquo; for you?<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Jo Lynn Feinstein:</strong> In Neurolinguistic Programming there&rsquo;s a concept that the meaning of our communication is the response we get. Good communication elicits the response we&rsquo;re seeking. When we don&rsquo;t get the response we desire, we need to challenge ourselves to find a different approach.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC:</strong> That sounds similar to our concept of intention. The idea of altering your delivery method to achieve a specific response from your audience.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JLF:</strong> It sounds very similar.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC:</strong> In your experience, what&rsquo;s the most challenging aspect of incorporating communication training into learning and development?<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JLF:</strong> Since everyone communicates every day, people think they already know all about it. Consequently, they aren&rsquo;t ready to learn. Building interest and enthusiasm becomes a prerequisite to actual learning.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC: </strong>Are most companies able to do this? Do they place the right amount of emphasis on communication as a skill?<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JLF:</strong> Companies think their people know how to do this already, so they don&rsquo;t invest in developing this skill. Real communication is hard. We need to say what we mean, but say it in a way that the other person will understand, and be aware and considerate of the other&rsquo;s feelings. Think about your last disagreement. Was there a critical issue or was it the result of a misunderstanding?<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC:</strong> Uh, Red Carpet pleads the 5<sup>th</sup>.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JLF: </strong>(<em>laughs</em>)<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC:</strong> As an ASTD coordinator, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen a lot of great speakers.

Riley Mills did a fantastic job at our recent LA chapter meeting.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC: </strong>Thanks for the unsolicited plug! (<em>whispers</em>) Your check is in the mail.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JLF: </strong>(<em>laughs</em>) No problem.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC: </strong>How has the emergence of technology redefined communication skills in the realm of Human Resources?<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JLF:</strong> Technology&rsquo;s accelerated and enlarged the flow of information, and participants in learning activities have access to seemingly unlimited amounts of it. We need to be on our toes to make sure our information is current and meaningful, whether it&rsquo;s a learner in a training activity or a colleague on the job.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC:</strong> Pinnacle&rsquo;s fond of using quotations throughout its materials. Do you have a favorite one you&rsquo;d like to leave us with?<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>JLF:</strong> &ldquo;<em>When the best leader&rsquo;s work is done the people will say, we did it ourselves!</em>&rdquo; &ndash;Lao Tzu<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If our interactions with those around us can engender this feeling of self-accomplishment, we&rsquo;ve been effective.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RC:</strong> This has been great.

You have writer&rsquo;s block.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Whether delivering a presentation, a keynote address or just trying to rock star some opening remarks, forcing creativity is a struggle for many. The blank screen or page is many a writer&rsquo;s nemesis. The problem is so prevalent, support groups exist, in both online and offline versions, to help writers break through the wall.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The causes are numerous. Whether it&rsquo;s fear of failure, being bored by a subject, the pressure of having to meet a deadline, or some combination of the above, each writer suffers in their own way.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Just as stage fright has no universal remedy, writer&rsquo;s block doesn&rsquo;t have a collective un-clogger. Culled from articles and interviews, here are Red Carpet&rsquo;s four best ways to burst the dam that&rsquo;s stopping your creative juices.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Start Where You Want. </strong>Just because your material has a beginning, middle and end doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to create it that order. Many writers take the opposite approach, crafting the conclusion first. It can be easier to know how something starts if you know where it&rsquo;s going. Ultimately, writing what part interests you most will make it less burdensome and may generate ideas for how to approach other sections.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Put <em>Something</em> On the Page. </strong>The scariest things about the blank page are the possibilities. It can go <em>anywhere</em>. Define some limits. Write one word, or a sentence that contains a core idea behind your content. Boundaries and direction may be the catalysts to get your brain moving.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Lower Your Standards. </strong>Don&rsquo;t edit and compose at the same time. Worry about the perfect way to say it later. Shutting off your self-critiquing allows for more ideas to hit the page. Even if they don&rsquo;t make the final cut, they may lead to something worth holding onto.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Talk It Out. </strong>Grab your spouse or call a friend. Make sure you record it. Turning something from text into speech engages different parts of the brain and might knock a few extra ideas loose. Words that were eluding you may come more naturally if you force yourself to speak through it.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>These are great methods to use when approaching any creative endeavor, brainstorm or groupthink exercise, not just when preparing scripted material. Writer&rsquo;s block may not be avoidable, but a little mental grease can go a long way.</p>', '1', 'en'),

Maybe it was a presentation, or a three-foot putt, or your maid-of-honor remarks, but in spite of all your preparation and/or the fact you could do it in your sleep, you bombed it.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Why?<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In <em>Choke</em>, Dr. Sian Beilock investigates this curious phenomenon, details some fascinating findings and offers some concrete ways to handle pressure.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{poll} The first mistake to <em>not </em>make is to associate your failure with a high amount of preparation (&ldquo;Things went so wrong&hellip;I must have prepared <em>too much!&rdquo;</em>). This wariness of over-preparation is one of the most frequently expressed concerns in Pinnacle workshops, and Dr. Beilock&rsquo;s research dispels the myth.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, what fouls us up is the allocation of the brain&rsquo;s resources. High pressure situations usually mean we desire to control the outcome. In our attempt to ensure success, our awareness jumps to new heights and we focus on elements that would be better left on autopilot. Moving the subconscious (everything you prepared) into the conscious portion of the brain effectively nullifies work done to make it autonomous.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Have you ever had someone tell you to relax? If so, then you&rsquo;ve probably experienced a variation of the phenomenon we&rsquo;re talking about. As soon as you start <em>trying</em> to relax, the act of doing it becomes much more difficult.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How can we prevent this from happening? Dr. Beilock has some suggestions:<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t Think About It.</strong> Easier said than done, Red Carpet knows. Essentially, distract yourself. Do something physically or mentally engaging (smartphones are great for this) prior to your pressure cooker to take your mind off of it. Trust yourself and let your preparation do its work.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Simulate Stress.</strong> Practicing your presentation in front of your spouse is much different than delivering it to a roomful of executives. The game-changer: the stakes are higher, the stress is greater. Find opportunities to practice under low-stakes pressure so performance stress becomes more tolerable.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Envision the Result.</strong> According to Beilock, focusing on the result of your actions helps trigger your body to use its practiced skills. For Pinnacle grads, this is synonymous with focusing on your intention. Concern yourself with your audience&rsquo;s reaction and let the content take care of itself.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Knowing the science behind the stress gives us the ability to make adjustments. Armed with a little more knowledge and a lot of preparation, you\'ll be better equipped to get out of your own way.</p>', '1', 'en'),

Surely we\'ve all heard the maxims and imperatives surrounding the bookends of presentations: "You never get a second chance to make a first impression." "Finish strong!" Why is the largest portion of presentations, the 80% in the middle, so neglected by conventional wisdom?

Presenters usually find themselves in the position of having to convey a lot of new information in a very short period of time (i.e. sales calls, project updates). The natural inclination is to include exhaustive details, to fully plumb the depths of the given topic and leave no stone unturned. &ldquo;How is client X supposed to realize how great our company is unless I tell him all about it?&rdquo; &ldquo;How is my team to make decisions without knowing the intricacies of our project?&rdquo; More information means greater understanding, right? Wrong. And Red Carpet is here to tell you why.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What did you do last weekend?<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A simple question that isn&rsquo;t so simple to answer. Sure, you might be able to recount major events (went to the movies, had the family over, took the kids to a birthday party), but moments outside those &ldquo;markers&rdquo; would be more difficult to recall. Our brains do an excellent job of filtering out mundane details. In order to preserve energy, save us headaches and reserve resources for higher cognitive functions, they look for opportunities to go on autopilot. Routine activities typically trigger this somatic automation. We&rsquo;ve done certain things so many times before, as soon as our brains recognize the patterned behavior, <em>click!</em>, we go on autopilot.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The identical result occurs when confronted with too much information. Our brains search for the aforementioned markers, something that stands out amidst the white noise. If too much material is thrown at an audience, there is a dilution of what&rsquo;s important. In essence, everything becomes mundane, and their autopilots begin to activate.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Red Carpet has written in past newsletters about attention spans and maximizing retention rates. Content selection is another face of that many-sided coin. &ldquo;Less is more&rdquo; is an oft-repeated clich&eacute; that contains truth but offers no practical answers. What is one to do? Here are three simple guidelines that will help you distill your content:<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pick Three.</strong> Limit yourself to three major ideas/concepts/points. <em>No more</em>. One of the hardest things to do as a playwright, screenwriter or author is make cuts. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much good info!&rdquo; No, there isn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;All these details are important!&rdquo; No, they&rsquo;re not. Make hard choices about what stays and what goes. If you&rsquo;re having a hard time being objective, involve someone else. Another set of eyes and ears can be invaluable.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Start Small.</strong> If you&rsquo;ve been allotted time to present, don&rsquo;t plan on using every second. Challenge yourself to be as concise as possible. What would your presentation look like if you <em>had </em>to deliver it in five minutes? How about ten? Fifteen? Instead of trying to whittle everything down to fit your given timeframe, build your presentation in reverse by gradual addition. Stop when you reach 75-80% of your time allotment.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>WIDLIO.</strong> Syntax artists may recognize this acronym: <strong>W</strong>hen <strong>I</strong>n <strong>D</strong>oubt, <strong>L</strong>eave <strong>I</strong>t <strong>O</strong>ut. While English teachers may have had commas in mind when devising this mnemonic device, it can apply to content as well. Apply those scissors liberally. Make certain you rank the contents of your cutting room floor. If you change your mind or need to add more at a later date, knowing what almost made the grade will be valuable.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The urge for a presenter to &ldquo;show up and throw up&rdquo; every little detail can be difficult to resist. By distilling your content down and skimming the cream, you not only reduce audience distractions but also gain more control over what they retain. A bit of extra effort and some hard choices can make &ldquo;less is more&rdquo; truly win/win.</p>', '1', 'en'),

Over the centuries, our brains have learned how to cope with a variety of stimuli and situations. One of the strongest reactions we can experience is what is commonly known as &ldquo;fight or flight.&rdquo; Simply put, it is our body&rsquo;s automatic response to a perceived threat. Across cultures, continents and the animal kingdom, the reaction is uniform&mdash;whether it is prey fleeing a predator or you presenting at a high stakes meeting.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while human civilization has evolved, our biochemistry remains firmly rooted in the Stone Age. While we&rsquo;re thinking &ldquo;boardroom,&rdquo; our bodies are screaming &ldquo;<em>bail out!</em>&rdquo; What causes such an acute reaction? And what exactly is happening to make us feel so <em>nervous</em>? Red Carpet has the answers.<br /> <br /> It may be odd to think that our brains are actually trying to do us a favor when we experience stage fright. Our mind has identified a situation which poses a threat, and it wants to protect us. Unfortunately there is no discrimination between physical and emotional threats, so we react staring to down a room of executives as we would to being chased by a hungry bear. The expectations of professional decorum make it difficult to take advantage of the body&rsquo;s stress response.<br /> <br /> There are multiple triggers as your brain preps your body for action.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Breathing quickens and heart rate accelerates.</strong> To ensure the body has enough oxygen to power the expected increase in activity, the lungs and heart go into overdrive. This is why your heart pounds, your face flushes and breathing becomes difficult.<br /> <br /> <strong>Muscles tense and sweat glands start pumping. </strong>These are primarily for the &ldquo;fight&rdquo; half of the stress response. Tension provides more power for hand to hand combat and more sweat means an increased cooling factor.<br /> <br /> <strong>Butterflies, the jitters and altered perception.</strong> These are primarily for the &ldquo;flight&rdquo; response. The brain opens the adrenalin and epinephrine floodgates, and our bloodstreams fill with energizing hormones. It feels good to move because our brain is screaming, &ldquo;<em>run!</em>&rdquo; Increased alertness means changes in how we perceive the passage of time.<br /> <br /> In addition, our body starts to shut down non-essential functions: digestion slows as blood is diverted elsewhere, salivary glands become inhibited (dry mouth) and bladder and bowel muscles slacken (the pervasive feeling of having to go to the bathroom).<br /> <br /> The most important thing to remember while all these symptoms are manifesting is that <em>you always feel more nervous than you appear. </em>That may be small consolation when your heart is pounding and you feel like vomiting, but many expressions of stage fright can be surprisingly subtle and nearly invisible, especially in large venues. Once your mind realizes the threat isn&rsquo;t immediate (hopefully a few minutes into your presentation), it will reduce the stress response and symptoms will mostly disappear.<br /> <br /> Stress responses manifest in the body but originate in the mind. The battle to tackle stage fright is mostly mental and can be largely won with proper preparation combined with the other techniques Pinnacle has given you. Remember that reduction of symptoms, not elimination, is the goal, and you&rsquo;re halfway toward being a more calm and confident communicator.</p>', '1', 'en'),

While Red Carpet is certain most people would award on-demand entertainment and the internet mostly positive marks, every rose has its proverbial thorn. The ability to stream what we want when we want it and the power to switch web pages instantly grants us more control over how we occupy our time, and, inevitably, there are repercussions when we lose that control.</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Gone are the days of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, the Illinois senatorial contests of 1858, where audience members listened in rapt attention, on many occasions, for over <em>three hours</em>. Accessibility and convenience are the watchwords of modern entertainment, and the paradigm shift has had an impact on the modern presenter.</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">While the numbers vary on the exact amount of time it takes for an audience\'s attention to wander, much of it depends on the type of attention being applied:</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><em>Focused attention - </em>the type of attention we pay sudden stimuli (a loud noise, quick movement in our peripheral vision, etc.). The maximum span for this type of occurrence is only a few seconds.</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><em>Sustained attention</em> - the type of attention that requires voluntary commitment (movies, conversations, presentations, etc.). Most adults have a maximum attention span of 20 minutes before having to renew it.</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Twenty minutes is not much time. That number also does not account for many of the obstacles working against a presenter (fatigue, hunger, stress, etc.), so it is fair to say a presenter shouldn\'t rely on it.</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Researchers also found attention spans lengthened and were renewed more often when audiences:</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; did something they enjoyed or</p>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were intrinsically motivated.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Since the first is a no-brainer, Red Carpet will focus on the second item. "Intrinsic motivation" is another way of saying "investment in the outcome." How does a presenter encourage her audience to invest in what she has to say? The answer lies in hooks.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="color: #000000;">Hooks are unique attention grabbers meant to reel in your audience. They encourage the investment mentioned above because they appeal to audiences on multiple levels. Your Pinnacle training and manual discussed hooks, but here are some more advanced elements to keep in mind.</span><br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Use early, use often.</strong> Hooks work well as early attention grabbers, but don&rsquo;t be afraid to sprinkle them throughout. Some work well as bookends or can be doled in segments. As mentioned earlier, 20 minutes is the most you can expect from people, so you may have to continually hook them.</span><br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Don&rsquo;t steal your own thunder. </strong>Stories and other hooks that have climaxes can be tricky. The payoff must be proportional to the time spent building it up. That said, resist the urge to give away the gold early. An aura of mystery and teasing the audience with the conclusion is a great way to keep them intellectually and emotionally invested.</span><br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Multiple points, multiple hooks.</strong> Resist the urge to overuse one type of hook. If you started off with a story, throw in a quote or an interesting statistic.

Even for those professionally involved in creative fields, the spark of creativity can often remain just out of reach. For many presenters, one of the most frequent challenges is finding new and innovative ways to approach dry material. Indeed, if you are not one who thinks of him/herself as a creative person, the task becomes doubly difficult.

(People that describe themselves as "right or left-brained" are promoting this theory, whether they know it or not.) Brain lateralization states that humans use the halves of their brains for different functions and that, generally speaking, creative people use the right side of their brain more often. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">By reviewing the columns below, tally how many times you match the given associations.

This is especially important for those that deal with highly technical material or fill the role of an instructor. Pinnacle graduates know the best way to ensure their audiences remember what\'s important is to keep them engaged with a strong intention and proficient application of our core building blocks. But what else can one do? What additional methods can a presenter utilize to make the most of time spent in front of an audience?</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Educators have known for many years that not all students respond identically to classroom stimuli. While there are many differing theories concerning how people learn, one of the most commonly accepted and frequently cited is VAK (Visual/Auditory/Kinesthetic).</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Pioneered in the 1920s and further evolved and adapted by Neil Fleming and others, the VAK distinctions can be a boon for a savvy presenter. VAK proponents hold that each person assimilates and processes information in a preferred manner. Presenters that know their audience can skew their presentations toward a certain learning style. Presenters that regularly deal with new audiences should include a variety of "carriers" for their information.</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong>VAK Breakdown and How to Use the Styles</strong></p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong>Visual</strong> (preferred by 65% of the population)</p>\r\n<p style="color: #000000; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">As any Pinnacle grad knows, visual components tend to resonate the most with audiences, and the VAK theory supports that conclusion.

The flip side to this phenomenon is that, if not used correctly, these same tools can actually do the opposite.</p>\r\n<p>In the world of professional presentations, PowerPoint is king. First debuting in 1987 as a program called "Presenter," the version that revolutionized the workplace did not appear until ten years later. It has been a staple, for better or worse, of boardrooms, lecture halls and meetings ever since.</p>\r\n<p>"Without a doubt, across continents, cultures, and businesses, one of the most misunderstood tools in the professional arsenal is PowerPoint," says Pinnacle co-founder, Gary Mills.</p>\r\n<p>He is not alone in this belief. Hundreds of websites (www.beyondbulletpoints.com), books (<em>Cutting Edge PowerPoint for Dummies</em>) and, ironically, PowerPoint "decks" have been created to help the uninitiated master the slide-creating software. Catchphrases such as "PowerPoint Hell" and "PowerPoint Poisoning" are now a part of the professional vernacular. How can one tool be so embedded in professional culture, yet be so misunderstood? How can one avoid the common missteps that plague so many presentations?</p>\r\n<p>"Microsoft will teach you how to use Word, but not how to be a writer," analogizes Roger Courville, author of <em>The Virtual Presenter\'s Handbook</em>. While his point is more directed toward webinars and other forms of virtual communication, the idea is applicable toward PowerPoint. A misunderstanding of the medium and how it should be used is the underlying culprit.</p>\r\n<p>At some point since its inception, PowerPoint became more than a visual supplement. Ellen Finkelstein, author of <em>101 Advanced Techniques Every PowerPoint User Should Know</em><em>, believes it started in academia. </em></p>\r\n<p>"When PowerPoint emerged, professors used it as a substitute not only for what they had written on the blackboard (whiteboard, by that time), but for their notes. Now they didn\'t have to write on the board each class, and they didn\'t have to read from their notes. They could show the students more of their notes!"</p>\r\n<p>Finkelstein makes the case that presenters today are only repeating what they have seen. Bad lectures in school and bad presentations in the boardroom beget more of the same. PowerPoint is oftentimes being used in ways for which it was never designed: as a substitution for documents and a catalogue of minutia.</p>\r\n<p>How can one avoid PowerPoint pitfalls?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Embrace the Medium</strong>-PowerPoint is a visual tool, so use images instead of text whenever possible. The idea that A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words means your audience will absorb broader topics and concepts quicker, and it will prevent you from getting bogged down in unnecessary details.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Keep It Simple</strong>-Reduce the number of slides and the amount of text on the slides as much as possible. There is a difference between "Need-to-Know" and "Need-to-Show." The audience will spend more time listening and less time reading.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Be Aesthetically Sensible</strong>-Be conscious of colors, fonts, type sizes, backgrounds, etc. Remain stylistically consistent with how your slides appear. Oftentimes, colors and text size can change from computer to projector, so double check your technology.</p>\r\n<p>For more information on this topic, Red Carpet encourages you to read the essays of Edward Tufte. Red Carpet also recommends <em>The Wall Street Journal Guide to Information Graphics</em> by Dona M. Wong for those that work with statistics, tables and charts on a regular basis.</p>\r\n<p>By changing perspectives on Microsoft\'s workplace warhorse, hopefully we can change the presentation paradigm and administer the antidote to PowerPoint Poisoning.</p>', '1', 'en'),

Or do you forget why you walked into the kitchen? Our memories can be tricky to manage. We want to believe that what we put in them is stored safely, and when we cannot retrieve the information we blame ourselves for the faulty recall. The reality is that our mind is not the fool‐proof safe we imagine it to be, but we can help it along when it comes to improving the retention of newly acquired knowledge or skills.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Learning happens through different methods. We have instant, powerful emotional learning experiences David Sousa<sup>1</sup>refers to as &ldquo;flashbulb memories,&rdquo; which cause instantaneous and long‐lasting memories of an event. This information is permanently retained in memory without any effort or choice.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum is information that is presented during learning related activities. These memories suffer a natural decline in retention. In 1885 Hermann Ebbinghous discovered the exponential nature of forgetting. Through repeated tests over various time periods he studied the memorization of nonsense syllables and defined the Ebbinghous Forgetting Curve<sup>2</sup>. What he found was that memory retention was relative to the strength of the memory and time.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5>Applied to Modern Day Learning and Development</h5>\r\n<p>"Relative to the strength of the memory". What Ebbinghous discovered is that material will stick longer in memory if it is made more relevant and meaningful to the participant. This component is especially important as we want to ensure that all curricula are not only relevant but presented in a meaningful way. This encourages participants to relate to the material and makes it easier to grasp.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>"Time" &ndash; This factor is presented by Ebbinghouse as a multiplier. His learning curve initially demonstrates that the more time elapses the more material an individual forgets. His follow‐up experiments demonstrate that if you can practice learned skills/recite material at sufficient intervals then you can increase your retention.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The key to any successful training session is information retention. The key to retention is ensuring that the material participants are learning is relevant to them and that the curriculum is presented in a way that is also relevant and engaging.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Finally, we must also follow up all training with reinforcement activities and material on a regular basis to reinforce what participants have learned. Oftentimes, once training is delivered it is considered finished. Achieving return on a training investment means making sure participants are recalling, reusing and remembering what they have studied.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Even our memories need to be worked out every now and then to guarantee they are working at top form. For a solid training program, make certain that your participants get the most out of any training and ensure they are practicing their newly learned skills!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(1)Sousa, David A.

Managers and team members that appeared effective previously may have overcome some of their shortcomings by virtue of the fact that they communicated together face-to-face.<br /> <br /> Incorporating the virtual meeting into the process of collaborating and production upsets the established mechanisms for the team to meet its basic needs as identified by Shutz.<br /> <br /> Taking away face-to-face interaction removes the automatic feeling of inclusion. It becomes easy to overlook individuals that are not in the same room with you, including their potential input and position on issues raised. As a meeting leader, it is critical to ensure that you are constantly polling for understanding and feedback from all parties. Additionally, the use of names will further strengthen all participants\' feelings of inclusion and connectedness.<br /> <br /> Control is an issue that everyone struggles with, whether conscious or subconscious. Moving to the virtual environment, individuals lose some of the tools available to help them control their environment. For instance, one<br /> can no longer indicate a desire to contribute by raising a hand or making gestures. A participant can no longer provide cues to indicate consensus or disapproval. The lack of these tools chips away at our ability to control the environment and the flow of conversation. Incorporating deliberate meeting processes and organization (i.e. a clearly communicated agenda), along with proper control mechanisms, will help attendees feel more in control of their own environment.\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1103213581098&amp;s=3&amp;e=001FUVtYEibWy53ANEZUMiCpeKBHgqPRRBsuNN5yEeQQiObJx77VITDfRU-TAA8h-SBolcMh5a9X07aQ6ahktmVaix4RUzKS05t3G1znH_GEbu0zMkKiCsXQUyaZQ_93JXQ0_pZtbmlpUnb4PPc1Fr07vf-0L311EE_MyslfaRVOW8=" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" shape="rect">Click here to continue reading</a></div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top">\r\n<div><img src="http://ih.constantcontact.com/fs016/1101971666321/img/41.jpg" alt="Back Stage Pass" width="54" height="54" name="ACCOUNT.IMAGE.41" align="left" border="0" />Communication for the Virtual Environment - Get 50% off <br /> <br /> Ensure your message is received <br /> when you can\'t be seen</div>\r\n<br /> With today\'s global business demands, virtual meetings are a necessary alternative to their face-to-face counterparts. Lower costs, larger audiences, broader opportunities, immediacy and the ability to communicate more often make virtual communication a compelling and necessary choice.

On average, a person retains and remembers about ____ % of what they hear.</p>\r\n<p>(Read on for Answers)</p>\r\n<p>What is Active Listening...</p>\r\n<p>Communication is a two-way street between a speaker and their audience. Active listening is the foundation of effective communication and a way for an audience to take in information and respond to a speaker. It\'s much more than simply making eye contact.</p>\r\n<p><em>We have two ears and one mouth so we can listen twice as much as we speak.</em><em><br /></em><em>-Epictetus</em></p>\r\n<p>Why Active Listening...</p>\r\n<p>It can allow for and improve mutual understanding between two parties. As a speaker, you can receive immediate visual feedback from your audience simply by looking at them and interacting with them in verbal and non-verbal ways. Success and failure of this technique can both be seen in the new Golden Globe nominated movie, Up in the Air. The success of George Clooney\'s character, Ryan Bingham, is predicated on active listening. Bingham fires people for a living. To be successful he must focus on their reactions and their needs before he responds. He utilizes active listening. The new girl on the block, Anna Kendrick\'s Natalie Keener, is far less skilled in this area. Instead of listening she allows her own opinions to impede her interviews. Natalie misses cues, does not ask pertinent questions, and is ultimately ineffective because of her inflexibility. Ryan\'s approach yields much more favorable results. Up in the Air is entertaining, poignant and contains a series of great examples of active listening. This places it amongst Pinnacle\'s top 10 movies for 2009.</p>\r\n<p>Tips for Active Listening</p>\r\n<p>It\'s easy to talk about the process and fun to see our favorite actors do it in the movies, but to help you focus on the details, here are some tips to help practice active listening and keep it at the forefront of your mind.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Be other directed - have empathy for the speaker</li>\r\n<li>Acknowledge your emotional state and set aside opinions</li>\r\n<li>Focus on the subject</li>\r\n<li>Avoid distractions</li>\r\n<li>Ask questions</li>\r\n<li>Take notes</li>\r\n<li>Use nonverbal communication</li>\r\n<li>Paraphrase what you have heard</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Keep these handy, especially before an important interaction to remind yourself to focus not just on your message but on the audience.</p>\r\n<p>Some other great movies featuring examples of active listening:</p>\r\n<div>The Informant<br />The Hurt Locker</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Fact Check Answers: According to experts, 80% of everything we learn is learned through listening.
